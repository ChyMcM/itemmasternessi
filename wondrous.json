It functions as a bag of holding and is available in a variety of colors and styles.\n\nClass-Based Living Loot Satchel\nClass\tSatchel\nBarbarian\tBroad belt with a dozen hanging pockets\nBard\tLute case\nCleric\tHollowed-out holy tome\nDruid\tMade from natural, organic, locally sourced woven fibers\nFighter\tA thick, battle-scarred iron lockbox\nPaladin\tA metal case with fine engraving and scrollwork\nRanger\tA fur-lined bindle\nRogue\tA nondescript coin pouch\nSorcerer\tA battered leather satchel, prone to spitting out multicolored sparks at the seams\nWarlock\tA patchwork monster-leather satchel with a “purely decorative” fanged mouth.\nWizard\tA pocket dimension hidden up your sleeve or inside your hat\nThe living loot satchel is a kind of magical being that safeguards the franchise’s funds and valuables. Its innards are connected to a secure coffer within Head Office’s vault in Waterdeep, to which the satchel periodically transfers the franchise’s wealth. As an action, you can transfer any amount of your franchise funds back to your satchel with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.\n\nSecret Satchel\nAs a rank 3 hoardsperson, your living loot satchel gets an upgrade to function as the replica chest used for the Leomund’s secret chest spell, becoming a rare magic item. You can open the secret chest through your living loot satchel to deposit or withdraw items—even items that wouldn’t normally fit in your satchel, but which fit within the chest. Thanks to Head Office striking deals you don’t want to know about with extraplanar creatures you really don’t want to know about, there is no chance for the spell to end.\n\nThat Thing You Need\nAt rank 3, you can use a bonus action to reach into your living loot satchel and make a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a success, you draw forth an item of your choice on the Adventuring Gear table in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook. The item must be of a size that can fit into your secret chest and be worth no more than 15 gp. Once you attempt to draw five items from your satchel, you cannot draw forth any more items until the next dawn.\n\nPortable Hole Satchel\nAt rank 4, your living loot satchel receives another upgrade, becoming a very rare magic item. The secret chest accessed by your satchel now has the storage capacity of a portable hole—6 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. As before, you can place any appropriately sized object into the portable-hole-sized chest, even if it wouldn’t normally fit into your satchel.\n\nThat Expensive Thing You Need\nAlso at rank 4, when you use your That Thing You Need feature, you can requisition any item of up to 250 gp in value, as long as it would fit into the confines of your satchel’s portable hole."

When such a roll is made, you can use a reaction to grant a d10 to a different creature you can see.

The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your occultant abacus at the next dawn.\n\nCorrect the Balance\nAs a rank 4 occultant, you learn that sometimes the death of a creature has unintended consequences. Within seven days of a creature’s death, you can use your occultant abacus to divine ways to reverse or mitigate events resulting from that death. As an action, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check. On a success, you learn the relevant information based on the nature of the creature and its place in the world.\n\nIf you fail the check, this property of the occultant abacus can’t be used again until the next dawn.

This effect lasts as long as the hag maintains Concentration. Multiple hags in the coven can see through the Hag Eye simultaneously.\n\nCreating a Hag Eye. Only a hag coven can craft this item, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or another wearable item. A hag coven can have only one Hag Eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a special rite. This rite takes 1 hour, and the hags can’t perform it if one or more of them has the Incapacitated condition. If the hags take any other actions during this rite, the rite fails and ends."

Most of these boxes are made of infernal iron, though some are carved from bone or horn. Infernal puzzle boxes are used to safeguard diabolical contracts signed between devils and mortals, even after the terms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty infernal puzzle box weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it.\n\nWhen an object small enough to fit inside an infernal puzzle box is placed in it, the container magically seals shut around the object, and no magic can force the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every infernal puzzle box is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular infernal puzzle box, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box’s contents.\n\nA creature that spends 1 hour holding an infernal puzzle box while trying to open it can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."

The DC is 10 + twice the level of the spell slot you expend to cast the spell.\n\nOn a successful check, you cast the spell as normal, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier.

In the mortal world and on other planes, the effects of illusion seeds last for 2d12 hours and then crumble away in a small burst of glittering light and shadows.\n\nTo use an illusion seed, its owner merely needs to throw it 5 feet or more from themselves (to avoid being caught in the magical effect).

A swallowed creature can cut its way out by attacking the flower from the inside with a weapon that deals slashing damage. The flower has AC 14 and 30 hit points.

A creature that is on fire takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of its turn, and can repeat the saving throw using an action, ending the effect on a success. The torch cannot be extinguished except by magical means.\n6\tOval, Russet\tA hollow shell resembling a large oval-shaped seed sprouts from the earth. This shell splits down the middle into two halves. Each half can be taken and wielded as a standard shield. Anyone wielding one of these shields has resistance to fire damage.\n7\tHeart, Green\tA gnarled staff covered in ivy and fruit-bearing grapevines grows in the spot where the seed was sown. The staff can be taken and wielded as a quarterstaff. Treat this weapon as though it were under the effect of a shillelagh spell for as long as the staff exists.\n8\tTeardrop, Purple\tThe seed grows into a Huge mushroom with a wooden door in its stalk and a small stone chimney rising from its cap.

A packet contains enough smokepowder for five shots, and a keg holds enough smokepowder for five hundred shots.\n\nIf smokepowder is set on fire, dropped, or otherwise handled roughly, it explodes and deals fire damage to each creature or object within 20 feet of it: 1d6 for a packet, 9d6 for a keg. A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.\n\nCasting dispel magic on smokepowder renders it permanently inert."

    "description": "Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus\n\nSoul coins are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag’s curse.\n\nCarrying Soul Coins. To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it — overcome with rage or fraught with despair.\n\nAn evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.\n\nUsing a Soul Coin. A soul coin has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a soul coin and use it to do one of the following:\n\nDrain Life. You siphon away some of the soul’s essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.\n\nQuery. You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.\n\nFreeing a Soul. Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin’s charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM’s choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.\n\nA soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon or an infernal war machine’s furnace (see \"Soul Fuel\").\n\nFreeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.\n\nHellish Currency. Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.\n\nSoul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes."

It has a staff of three: a cook, a bartender, and a servant, of a type typical of the region (so humans in a human realm, shadow fey in the Shadow Realm, goblins in the wastelands, and so on).\n\nUsing a tavern seed in an existing settlement creates a snug tavern as normal, magically shifting two buildings to either side slightly to make room. The new structure is certainly notable and surprising to residents of the place.\n\nA tavern seed combined with a road seed always includes a set of warm, secure stables as well as the tavern building itself.\n\nIllusion Seeds\nIllusion seeds are wondrous items first created in the Shadow Realm and reliant on a supply of shadow matter to power their effects—each such seed generates an illusion and those illusions can take quite powerful forms. While illusion seeds are fairly permanent in the Shadow Realm, where there is shadow matter to empower and sustain the illusions, they are notably less permanent anywhere else. In the mortal world and on other planes, the effects of illusion seeds last for 2d12 hours and then crumble away in a small burst of glittering light and shadows.\n\nTo use an illusion seed, its owner merely needs to throw it 5 feet or more from themselves (to avoid being caught in the magical effect).

One horn becomes a +1 Lance, and the other becomes a +2 Longsword. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days have passed.\n\nGoat of Traveling. This figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges.\n\nGoat of Travail. This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed."

While illusion seeds are fairly permanent in the Shadow Realm, where there is shadow matter to empower and sustain the illusions, they are notably less permanent anywhere else. In the mortal world and on other planes, the effects of illusion seeds last for 2d12 hours and then crumble away in a small burst of glittering light and shadows.\n\nTo use an illusion seed, its owner merely needs to throw it 5 feet or more from themselves (to avoid being caught in the magical effect). Once expended, their effects are permanent (in the Shadow Realm), though they can be unraveled using dispel magic (DC 13).\n\nillusion seed"

Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet. The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.\n\nRetrieving an item from the haversack requires a Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.\n\nIf any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an Artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again.\n\nEach pouch of the haversack holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nPlacing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened."

The birdfolk races of Humblewood consider the giving of a feather to be one of the highest honors one can bestow, and it represents an eternal bond or deep appreciation.\n\nThe helm has 3 charges that, while wearing it, you can use to activate its abilities. The helm has different properties based on the race of the birdfolk who gifted the feather.\n\nLuma. You can use a charge to cast a random 1st-level spell from the sorcerer spell list, then roll a d20. On a roll of 20, you may use this ability again without expending a charge. On a roll of 1, the spell also targets you, unless you are its only target, in which case the spell fizzles to no effect. Any spell cast using this helm that requires a saving throw has a save DC of 16.\n\nThe helm regains 1d3 charges each day at dawn.\n\nA True Gift\n\nWhether you are playing through the Humblewood adventure, or playing your own campaign in the Wood, look for organic relationships between a character and the races of birdfolk. If one stands out, use that to decide what type of feather is offered to the player in this helm.\n\nAdditionally, a player whose character is a birdfolk may want to make this gift themselves. Make sure to create a narrative bond between this character and who they share a feather with—the gift of a feather is not something which should be given lightly."

For example, if your result was 17, you could turn a small forest up to 30 feet across into a grassland, create a grove of trees up to 240 feet across, create a 6-foot-wide flowing stream, overgrow 1,500 feet of an existing road, or other similar option. Only natural terrain you can see can be affected. Built structures, such as homes or castles, remain untouched, though roads and trails can be overgrown or hidden. On a failure, the terrain is unchanged. On a 1, an overshadow (see Tome of Beasts 2 or substitute with ghost) also appears and attacks you. On a 20, you can choose two options.\n\nDeities, fey lords and ladies, archdevils, demon lords, and other powerful rulers in the Shadow Realm can prevent these terrain modifications from happening in their presence or anywhere within their respective domains.\n\nShadow Lore. If you spend 10 minutes referencing this book while researching the Shadow Realm or its creatures, you double your proficiency bonus on Arcana, History, and Religion checks to recall lore about such subjects for the next 24 hours. If you don’t have proficiency in these skills, you instead gain proficiency in them for the next 24 hours, but you are only proficient when recalling information about the subjects of your research. This research can be done during a short rest.\n\nSpells. While holding the book, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: cloak of shadow* (1 charge), darkness (2 charges), mirror image (2 charges), phantasmal killer (4 charges), see invisibility (2 charges), seeming (5 charges), shadow gateway* (5 charges), shadow step* (4 charges), or slither* (2 charges). You can also use an action to cast the douse light* or minor illusion cantrips from the book without using any charges. (Spells marked with an asterisk are from Deep Magic.)\n\nRetributive Shadows. You can use an action to speak a special command word and rip the book in half. The book is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in a wave of shadow magic. Four 10-foot cubes of shadow move outward from the book in the cardinal directions, and each cube moves up to 20 feet each round, away from the point where the book was destroyed. This effect works like the creeping darkness (see Deep Magic) spell, except it creates four cubes instead of three, and the necrotic damage dealt by the spell increases by 1d6 for each charge remaining in the book. At the GM’s discretion, this effect can work like the incendiary cloud spell instead of the creeping darkness spell, except the cloud is a cloud of shadow that deals necrotic damage instead of fire damage, is centered on you, and the damage dealt by the spell increases by 1d4 for each charge remaining in the book.\n\nDC\tEffect\n8\tObscure a path and remove all signs of passage (30 feet per point over 7).\n10\tCreate a grove of trees (30 feet across per point over 9).\n11\tCreate or dry up a lake or pond (1 foot wide per point over 11).\n12\tCreate a flowing stream (1 foot wide per point over 11).\n13\tOvergrow an existing road with brush or trees (300 feet per point over 12).\n14\tShift a river to a new course (300 feet per point over 13).\n15\tMove a forest (300 feet per point over 14).\n16\tCreate a small hill, riverbank, or cliff (10 feet tall per point over 15).\n17\tTurn a small forest into grassland or clearing or vice versa (30 feet across per point over 16).\n18\tCreate a new river (10 feet wide per point over 17).\n19\tTurn a large forest into grassland or vice versa (300 feet across per point over 19).\n20\tCreate a new mountain (1,000 feet high per point over 19).\n22\tShrink an existing hill or mountain (reducing 1,000 feet per point over 21).\nEbon Tides In Midgard\nWritten by an elven princess at the Court of Silver Words, this volume encodes her understanding and mastery of shadow. Whimsical illusions suffuse every page, animating its illuminated capital letters and ornamental figures. The book is a famous work among the sable elves of the Shadow Realm, and it opens to the touch of any elfmarked or sable elf character."

    "description": "Princes of the Apocalypse\n\nA devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a devastation orb of air. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.\n\nA devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates 1d100 hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as identify and divination can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.\n\nA special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb’s opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a devastation orb of air and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes 1d6 rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.\n\nRegardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere’s point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use.\n\nAir Orb. When this orb detonates, it creates a powerful windstorm that lasts for 1 hour. Whenever a creature ends its turn exposed to the wind, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage, as the wind and debris batter it. The wind is strong enough to uproot weak trees and destroy light structures after at least 10 minutes of exposure. Otherwise, the rules for strong wind apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.\n\nEarth Orb. When this orb detonates, it subjects the area to the effects of the earthquake spell for 1 minute (spell save DC 18). For the purpose of the spell’s effects, the spell is cast on the turn that the orb explodes.\n\nFire Orb. When this orb detonates, it creates a dry heat wave that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for extreme heat apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. At the end of each hour, there is a ten percent chance that the heat wave starts a wildfire in a random location within the area of effect. The wildfire covers a 10-foot-square area initially but expands to fill another 10-foot square each round until the fire is extinguished or burns itself out. A creature that comes within 10 feet of a wildfire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3d6 fire damage.\n\nWater Orb. When this orb detonates, it creates a torrential rainstorm that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for heavy precipitation apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. If there is a substantial body of water in the area, it floods after 2d10 hours of heavy rain, rising 10 feet above its banks and inundating the surrounding area. The flood advances at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving away from the body of water where it began until it reaches the edge of the area of effect; at that point, the water flows downhill (and possibly recedes back to its origin). Light structures collapse and wash away. Any Large or smaller creature caught in the flood’s path is swept away. The flooding destroys crops and might trigger mudslides, depending on the terrain.\n\nDamage\nControl"

When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.\n\nYou gain the following benefits while wearing the helm.\n\nDiamond Light. As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits a 30-foot Emanation. When at least one Undead is within that area, the Emanation is filled with Dim Light. Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 Radiant damage.\n\nFire Opal Flames. As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can take a Magic action to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 Fire damage. The fl ames last until you take a Bonus Action to extinguish them or until you drop or stow the weapon.\n\nRuby Resistance. As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have Resistance to Fire damage.\n\nSpells. You can cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm’s gems of the specified type as a component: Daylight (opal), Fireball (fire opal), Prismatic Spray (diamond), or Wall of Fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.\n\nTaking Fire Damage. Roll 1d20 if you are wearing the helm and take Fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems and is then destroyed. Each creature within a 60-foot Emanation originating from you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking Radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm."

In addition, you know the exact location and type of all devils within 1,000 feet of you. You can telepathically communicate with a devil within range, or you can broadcast your thoughts to all devils within range. The devils receiving your broadcasted thoughts have no special means of replying to them.\n\nThe helm has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast dominate monster (save DC 21), which affects devils only. (The spell fails and the charge is wasted if you target any creature that’s not a devil.) If a devil can see you when you cast this spell on it, the devil knows you tried to charm it. The helm regains all its charges 24 hours after its last charge is expended.\n\nIf you are not a devil, using the helm’s dominate monster property in the Nine Hells has a 20 percent chance of attracting a narzugon, which arrives on the back of a nightmare mount in 1d4 hours. The narzugon tries to recover the helm, killing you if necessary to obtain it. If it gets the helm, the narzugon tries to deliver it to its infernal master."

You can transfer the ingot’s magic to a nonmagical item — a shield or a two-handed melee weapon — by tracing the skold rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other.

A creature that knows the mirror’s nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.\n\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.\n\nIf the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.\n\nWhile within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate.\n\nIn a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.\n\nPlacing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane.

As an action, you can touch a body of water and freeze the water in a 10-foot-radius sphere around the spot you touched. Once you use this property, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\nFrost Friend. You have resistance to fire damage.\n\nIcy Mantle. As an action, you can touch yourself or another creature with water on your finger. The water creates an icy mantle of protection.

You can transfer the shard’s magic to a nonmagical item — a cloak or a pair of boots — by tracing the ise rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the shard is destroyed, and the rune appears in blue on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:\n\nCloak. The cloak is now a rare magic item that requires attunement.
