While holding this wand, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, you ignore half cover when making a spell attack. Radiance is in the form of an exquisite golden hand mirror.

While surrounded by darkness, it sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. A creature that is attuned to Radiance can use a bonus action while holding the mirror to cast the enhance ability spell, choosing itself and no other creature as the spell’s target. Once this property of the wand is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Crafted by the drow, this slim black wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a small glob of viscous material to launch from the tip at one creature within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll against the target, with a bonus equal to your spellcasting modifier (or your Intelligence modifier, if you don’t have a spellcasting ability) plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the glob expands and dries on the target, which is restrained for 1 hour. After that time, the viscous material cracks and falls away.

Applying a pint or more of alcohol to the restrained creature dissolves the glob instantly, as does the application of oil of etherealness or universal solvent. The glob also dissolves instantly if exposed to sunlight. No other nonmagical process can remove the viscous material until it deteriorates on its own.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts into harmless slime and is destroyed.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and choose a target within 120 feet of you. The target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll d100 and consult the following table to discover what happens.

If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell's save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet if it isn't already. If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the GM randomly determines which ones are affected.
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.


d100	Effect
01-05	You cast slow.
06-10	You cast faerie fire.
11-15	You are stunned until the start of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened.
16-20	You cast gust of wind.
21-25	You cast detect thoughts on the target you chose. If you didn't target a creature, you instead take 1d6 psychic damage.
26-30	You cast stinking cloud.
31-33	Heavy rain falls in a 60-foot radius centered on the target. The area becomes lightly obscured. The rain falls until the start of your next turn.
34-36	An animal appears in the unoccupied space nearest the target. The animal isn't under your control and acts as it normally would. Roll a d100 to determine which animal appears. On a 01–25, a rhinoceros appears; on a 26–50, an elephant appears; and on a 51–100, a rat appears.
37-46	You cast lightning bolt.
47-49	A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 30‐foot radius centered on the target. The area becomes heavily obscured. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes.
50-53	You enlarge the target as if you had cast enlarge/reduce. If the target can't be affected by that spell, or if you didn't target a creature, you become the target.
54-58	You cast darkness.
59-62	Grass grows on the ground in a 60‐foot radius centered on the target. If grass is already there, it grows to ten times its normal size and remains overgrown for 1 minute.
63-65	An object of the GM's choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the target, and no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.
66-69	You shrink yourself as if you had cast enlarge/reduce on yourself.
70-79	You cast fireball.
80-84	You cast invisibility on yourself.
85-87	Leaves grow from the target. If you chose a point in space as the target, leaves sprout from the creature nearest to that point. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours.
88-90	A stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each worth 1 gp, shoots from the wand's tip in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the line.
91-95	A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from you in a 30‐foot radius. You and each creature in the area that can see must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
96-97	The target's skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days. If you chose a point in space, the creature nearest to that point is affected.
98-00	If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If you didn't target a creature, you become the target and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly petrified. On any other failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the target is freed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge while choosing a point within 120 feet of yourself. That location becomes the point of origin of a spell or other magical effect determined by rolling on the Wand of Wonder Effects table. Spells cast from the wand have a save DC of 15. If a spell’s maximum range is normally less than 120 feet, it becomes 120 feet when cast from the wand. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the DM determines randomly which among them are affected.

Regaining Charges. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.

Wand of Wonder Effects
1d100	Effect
01–20	You cast a spell originating from the chosen point. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a 1–2, Darkness; on a 3–4, Faerie Fire; on a 5–6, Fireball; on a 7–8, Slow; on a 9–10, Stinking Cloud.
21–25	Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you have the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened.
26–30	You cast Gust of Wind. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin.
31–35	Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you take 1d6 Psychic damage.
36–40	Heavy rain falls for 1 minute in a 120-foot-high, 60-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the chosen point of origin. During that time, the area of effect is Lightly Obscured.
41–45	A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 60-foot-high, 30-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the chosen point of origin. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes, during which time the area of effect is Heavily Obscured.
46–50	You cast Lightning Bolt. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin.
51–55	The creature closest to the chosen point of origin is enlarged as if you had cast Enlarge/Reduce on it. If the target isn’t you and can’t be affected by that spell, you become the target instead.
56–60	A magically formed creature appears in an unoccupied space as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. The creature isn’t under your control, acts as it normally would, and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. Roll 1d4 to determine which creature appears. On a 1, a Rhinoceros appears; on a 2, an Elephant appears; and on a 3–4, a Rat appears.
61–64	Grass covers a 60-foot-radius circle of ground, with the center of that circle as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. Grass that’s already there grows to ten times its normal size and remains overgrown for 1 minute.
65–68	An object of the DM’s choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the chosen point of origin, and no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. If there are no such objects in range, nothing happens.
69–72	Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you shrink as if you had cast Enlarge/Reduce on yourself and remain in that state for 1 minute.
73–77	Leaves grow from the creature nearest to the chosen point of origin. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours.
78–82	Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a burst of colorful, shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot Emanation. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
83–87	Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you cast Invisibility on yourself.
88–92	Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each worth 1 GP, shoots from the wand’s tip in a Line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide toward the chosen point of origin. Each gem deals 1 Bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the Line.
93–97	You cast Polymorph, targeting the creature closest to the chosen point of origin. Roll 1d4 to determine the target’s new form. On a 1, the new form is a Black Bear; on a 2, the new form is a Giant Wasp; on a 3–4, the new form is a Frog.
98–00	The creature closest to the chosen point of origin makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the Restrained condition and begins to turn to stone. While Restrained in this way, the creature repeats the save at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends. On a failed save, the creature has the Petrified condition instead of the Restrained condition. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the Greater Restoration spell or similar magic.
