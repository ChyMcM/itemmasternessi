This staff is formed from several strands of leafy vines that have grown together into the shape of a twisted walking stick. It is rigid and sturdy.

The staff has three command words. While holding the staff, you can speak one of its command words to cause an effect.

Growth. Speaking the first command word as a bonus action causes up to 120 feet of creeping vines to grow from the staff towards a solid surface or unattended object you can see. The vines grow at a speed of 30 feet per round.

Grasp. Speaking the second command word, costing no action causes the vines to firmly affix themselves to a surface or unattended object within their reach. The vines can only be anchored to one object or surface at a time.

Grapple. Speaking the third command word as an action causes the vines to retract into the staff at a speed of 30 feet per round. If anchored to a solid surface, the vines will pull the staff’s wielder towards the surface at the same speed. If anchored to an object, the vines will pull the object towards the wielder of the staff.

When the vines are extended, they can be attacked. The extended vines have an Armor Class of 14, 45 hit points, and vulnerability to fire and slashing damage. The vines have a Strength score of 16 and can bear up to 240 pounds of weight at once. Weight in excess of this will cause the vines to begin to tear, dealing 10 points of damage to them each round. If the vines drop to 0 hit points, the staff is destroyed. The vines regain all lost hit points when they retract into the staff.

If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its staff form. The staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.

Made from the branch of a Gulthias tree (see the blights entry in the Monster Manual), a Gulthias staff is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 of its expended charges daily at dusk.

If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die.

Vampiric Strike. The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff’s pores, and you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with short-term madness (see “Madness” in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

Blight Bane. While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don’t regard you as hostile unless you harm them.

Relics of Saint Vitruvio
These holy relics of the Sacred Flame were wielded by Saint Vitruvio and are kept in several religious sites throughout Drakkenheim. The Knights of the Silver Order and the Followers of the Falling Fire now seek these relics. Not only do both factions revere Saint Vitruvio, both wish to use these relics to help advance their goals in Drakkenheim.

A character attuned to three Relics of Saint Vitruvio may cast the heal spell three times per day, after which they must finish a long rest before they may do so again. In addition, that character gains the ability to attune to two additional magic items so long as those magic items are both Relics of Saint Vitruvio.
