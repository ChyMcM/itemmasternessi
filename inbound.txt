D&D Beyond Basic Rules

It’s up to you to decide whether a character has proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&D worlds wouldn’t have such proficiency. During their downtime, characters can use the training rules in the Player’s Handbook to acquire proficiency, assuming that they have enough ammunition to keep the weapons working while mastering their use.

An armblade is a magic weapon that attaches to your arm, becoming inseparable from you as long as you're attuned to it. To attune to this item, you must hold it against your forearm for the entire attunement period.

As a bonus action, you can retract the armblade into your forearm or extend it from there. While it is extended, you can use the weapon as if you were holding it, and you can't use that hand for other purposes.

Critical Role

Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.

Reload. The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.

Misfire. Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.

Explosive. Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

Ammunition

All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.

THIS IS UNOFFICIAL MATERIAL

These game mechanics are usable in your campaign if your DM allows them but not refined by final game design and editing. They aren’t officially part of the Dungeons & Dragons game and aren’t permitted in D&D Adventurers League events unless otherwise stated.

D&D Beyond Basic Rules

The double-bladed scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long, curving blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over centuries, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double-bladed scimitar is an expensive weapon (100 gp) — few though ever have the opportunity to purchase one. A Valenar blade in the hands of a non-elf is generally assumed to have been stolen or looted from a fallen foe, and a Valenar elf might feel entitled to demand its return or challenge the bearer to prove they’re worthy to wield it.

Special. If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

Critical Role

Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.

Reload. The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.

Misfire. Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.

Explosive. Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

Ammunition
All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.

THIS IS UNOFFICIAL MATERIAL

These game mechanics are usable in your campaign if your DM allows them but not refined by final game design and editing. They aren’t officially part of the Dungeons & Dragons game and aren’t permitted in D&D Adventurers League events unless otherwise stated.

Critical Role

Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.

Reload. The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.

Misfire. Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.

Explosive. Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

Ammunition

All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.

THIS IS UNOFFICIAL MATERIAL

These game mechanics are usable in your campaign if your DM allows them but not refined by final game design and editing. They aren’t officially part of the Dungeons & Dragons game and aren’t permitted in D&D Adventurers League events unless otherwise stated.

Proficiency with a net allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.

A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, pg. 76

The longsword, Tearulai, is a sentient, neutral good sword of sharpness with an emerald-colored blade and precious gemstones embedded in its hilt and pommel. The sword’s magical properties are suppressed until it is removed from Valdemar’s skull.

When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target’s limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

In addition, you can speak the sword’s command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.

Evil creatures can’t attune to Tearulai; any evil creature that tries to do so takes 20 psychic damage. The weapon’s emerald blade can’t be damaged or dulled, and the sword can’t be teleported anywhere without its wielder while the two are attuned to one another.

Spells. The sword has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. A creature attuned to the sword can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells from it without material components: fly (2 charges), polymorph (3 charges), or transport via plants (4 charges).

Sentience. The sword has an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates telepathically with its attuned wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Sylvan. In addition, the sword can ascertain the true value of any gemstone brought within 5 feet of it.

Personality. Tearulai admires great beauty, music, fine art, and poetry. Vain, the weapon strives to improve its appearance. It craves gemstones and seeks out better ones with which to adorn itself. Most of all, it longs to return to the forests around Myth Drannor, where it was created. If its wielder’s goals run counter to its own, Tearulai attempts to take control of its wielder and escape Undermountain, whereupon it can use its transport via plants spell to return whence it came.

Its handle is carved with leaves and vines, and the weapon weighs half as much as a normal battleaxe. When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a plant creature, the target takes an extra 1d8 slashing damage. When a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 piercing damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical.

The area becomes difficult terrain, and the foliage is thick enough to provide cover against ranged attacks. The growth is permanent unless you speak the command word again.

Curse of Strahd, pg. 221

Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe lived in the Balinok Mountains centuries before the arrival of Strahd von Zarovich. Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and he lived underground. In battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first blood spear, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.

When you hit with a melee attack using this magic spear and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points.

Any creature can wield the spear, but only the character chosen by Kavan to wield it gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This sword is a sentient lawful good +1 shortsword (Intelligence 11, Wisdom 13, Charisma 13). It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.

The sword’s purpose is to fight evil. The sword has the following additional properties:

The sword continually sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Only by destroying the sword can this light be extinguished.
A lawful good creature can attune itself to the sword in 1 minute.
While attuned to the weapon, the sword’s wielder can use the sword to cast the crusader’s mantle spell. Once used, this property of the sword can’t be used again until the next dawn.

This weapon is a long metal lance with a small flame that burns at its end. It has a hose coming from the hilt that connects to a metal tank that you wear on your back.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

The tank has 5 charges. You can use an action and expend one or more charges from the tank to cast burning hands (Save DC 15). For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

Once per day, you can pour a vial of alchemist’s fire into the tank. When you do, it regains all expended charges. It otherwise does not regain charges on its own.

Curse. This weapon is cursed and possessed by a vengeful spirit. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it on your person at all times. While attuned to this weapon, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.

In addition, while the weapon is on your person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever you take damage from another creature in combat. On a failed save, you must attack the creature that damaged you until you drop to 0 Hit Points or it does or until you can’t reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.

You can break the curse in the usual ways. Alternatively, casting Banishment on the weapon forces the vengeful spirit to leave it. The weapon then becomes a +1 Weapon with no other properties.

This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.

The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.

Each time you make an attack roll with this magic weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning damage instead of Piercing damage.

Lightning Bolt. When you throw this weapon at a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms a 5-foot-wide Line between you and the target. The target and each other creature in the Line (excluding you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Immediately after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in your hand. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Curse. This weapon is cursed and possessed by a vengeful spirit. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it on your person at all times. While attuned to this weapon, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.

In addition, while the weapon is on your person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever you take damage from another creature in combat. On a failed save, you must attack the creature that damaged you until you drop to 0 Hit Points or it does or until you can’t reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.

You can break the curse in the usual ways. Alternatively, casting Banishment on the weapon forces the vengeful spirit to leave it. The weapon then becomes a +1 Weapon with no other properties.

Curse. This weapon is cursed and possessed by a vengeful spirit. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it on your person at all times. While attuned to this weapon, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.

In addition, while the weapon is on your person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever you take damage from another creature in combat. On a failed save, you must attack the creature that damaged you until you drop to 0 Hit Points or it does or until you can’t reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.

You can break the curse in the usual ways. Alternatively, casting Banishment on the weapon forces the vengeful spirit to leave it. The weapon then becomes a +1 Weapon with no other properties.

Curse. This weapon is cursed and possessed by a vengeful spirit. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it on your person at all times. While attuned to this weapon, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.

In addition, while the weapon is on your person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever you take damage from another creature in combat. On a failed save, you must attack the creature that damaged you until you drop to 0 Hit Points or it does or until you can’t reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.

You can break the curse in the usual ways. Alternatively, casting Banishment on the weapon forces the vengeful spirit to leave it. The weapon then becomes a +1 Weapon with no other properties.

This small dart is decorated with designs like windy spirals that span the length of its shaft.

When you whisper the word “seek” and hurl this dart, it seeks out a target of your choice within 120 feet of you. You must have seen the target before, but you don’t need to see it now. If the target isn’t within range or if there is no clear path to it, the dart falls to the ground, its magic spent and wasted. Otherwise, elemental winds guide the dart instantly through the air to the target. The dart can pass though openings as narrow as 1 inch wide and can change direction to fly around corners.

When the dart reaches its target, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and 3d4 lightning damage. The dart’s magic is then spent, and it becomes an ordinary dart.

This boomerang is a ranged weapon carved from griffon bone and etched with the symbol of elemental air. When thrown, it has a range of 60/120 feet, and any creature that is proficient with the javelin is also proficient with this weapon. On a hit, the boomerang deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage and 3d4 thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. On a miss, the boomerang returns to the thrower’s hand.

Once the boomerang deals thunder damage to a target, the weapon loses its ability to deal thunder damage and its ability to stun a target. These properties return after the boomerang spends at least 1 hour inside an elemental air node.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger’s Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger’s Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger’s Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have Disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one.

Whenever another creature damages you while the weapon is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. This berserk state ends when you start your turn and there are no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

While berserk, you regard the creature nearest to you that you can see or hear as your enemy. If there are multiple possible creatures, choose one at random. On each of your turns, you must move as close to the creature as possible and take the Attack action, targeting the creature. If you’re unable to get close enough to the creature to attack it with the weapon, your turn ends after you’ve used up all your available movement. If the creature dies or can no longer be seen or heard by you, the next nearest creature that you can see or hear becomes your new target.

When you hit with an attack roll using this magic bow, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the same type as the breath infused in the bow—acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder.

If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when you pull back the string. The ammunition created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

Tyranny of Dragons

A dagger fashioned from the tooth of a dragon. While the blade is obviously a fang or predator’s tooth, the handle is leather wrapped around the root of the tooth, and there is no cross-guard.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls you make with this weapon. On a hit with this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 acid damage.

Draconic Potency. Against enemies of the Cult of the Dragon, the dagger’s bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra acid damage increases to 2d6.

When you hit with a ranged attack roll using this magic bow, the target takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage. If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when you make a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

While wielding this magic bow, you can use a bonus action to enter a semi-incorporeal state until the start of your next turn. While semi-incorporeal, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Once this bonus action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.

Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.

Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

An executioner’s blade from the Age of Arcanum, this magic greatsword is one of many similar weapons once used to execute magic-wielding criminals. Though most commonly found in the lands now known as Wildemount and Issylra, a few such blades have found their way to Tal’Dorei.

If you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can cast the dispel magic spell from the sword against the target as part of the attack. Alternatively, you can use an action to cast dispel magic from the sword against a target of your choice. If you need to make a check with your spellcasting ability modifier as part of casting the spell, you make this check with a +3 modifier or your own spellcasting ability modifier, whichever is higher.

Once you cast dispel magic using this weapon, you can’t do so again until the next dawn.

Used by the river giants to harvest memory fragments from the dark waters of the Shadow Realm, mooncatcher’s nets are woven by the priests of Hecate or by moonshadow catcher goblins.

You have a +1 bonus on attack rolls with this magic weapon. It has the normal effects of a net but is very tough. A creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength check to free itself or another creature from the net. Dealing 15 slashing damage to the net also frees the creature. The net has AC 14 and 25 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the net drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

As well as using the net as a weapon, you can drag the net through dark water (see Chapter 5 of Book of Ebon Tides) to harvest 1d4 random memory fragments. Roll 1d10 on the table below for each fragment to determine the memory fragment captured. Each memory fragment can be used as component in creating a memory philter of the type listed in parentheses. You must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to transfer each memory fragment from the net into a suitable container or it is lost.

1	Happy time with a friend (philter of boundless joy)
2	Embarrassing failure (philter of deep despair)

Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.

Curse of Strahd, pg. 222

Saint Markovia’s thighbone has the properties of a mace of disruption. If it scores one or more hits against a vampire or a vampire spawn in the course of a single battle, the thighbone crumbles into dust once the battle concludes.

As a youth, Markovia followed her heart and became a priest of the Morninglord soon after her eighteenth birthday. She proved to be a charismatic proselytizer and, before the age of thirty, had gained a reputation for allowing no evil to stand before her.

Markovia had long considered Strahd a mad tyrant, but only after his transformation into a vampire did she dare to challenge him. As she rallied her followers and prepared to march on Castle Ravenloft, Strahd sent a group of vampire spawn to her abbey. They confronted Markovia and were destroyed to a one.

Suffused with confidence born of righteous victory, Markovia advanced on Castle Ravenloft. A great battle raged from the catacombs to the parapets. In the end, Markovia never returned to Barovia, and Strahd long afterward walked with a limp and a grimace of pain. It is said that he trapped Markovia in a crypt beneath his castle, and her remains linger there yet.

The essence of Markovia’s saintliness passed partly into her bones as the rest of her body decomposed. Her remaining thighbone is imbued with power that inflicts grievous injury on the undead.

This quarterstaff was built from refined meteoric iron and has a liquid delerium core.

Once on your turn, when you hit a creature with a melee attack using this weapon, you can force the target to make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes an extra 3d6 psychic damage and can’t take reactions until the start of your next turn. In addition, on its next turn, the creature must choose to take an action, bonus action, or move: it may only do one of the three.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

As an action, you can hurl the weapon up to 120 feet to a point you can see. When it reaches that point, the weapon vanishes in an explosion, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Afterward, you can use an action to cause the weapon to reappear in your empty hand. You can’t cause it to explode again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you don’t call the weapon back to your hand, it reappears at the point where it exploded when you are no longer attuned to it or when 24 hours have passed.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger’s Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

More powerful variants of True Name gain an additional property depending on rarity:

Rare. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 1d6.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

Rare. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 1d6.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger’s Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

More powerful variants of True Name gain an additional property depending on rarity:

Rare. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 1d6.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

Player’s Handbook (2014)

An arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both arrows of dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw in addition to suffering the attack’s normal effects. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this effect three times, the effect ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for 1 hour.

A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to damage of the weapon’s type, does not have a body made of flesh, or has legendary actions.

Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a remove curse spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon. Whenever you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 1 on the attack roll, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be restrained and forced to make additional saves against being petrified, as above.

These steel crossbow bolts were first created by the Jaggenstrike Clan during the Scattered War, and the secret to crafting them remains well guarded by the Houses of Kraghammer. Cataclysm bolts are usually kept in sets of ten, though anyone who holds even one can feel it thrumming with magical power. When you hit with an attack using a cataclysm bolt, the attack deals normal damage. Then roll a d6 on the following table to determine its additional effect.

Cataclysm Bolt Effects
d6	Effect
1–2	The bolt explodes in a blast of fire, dealing 3d8 fire damage to the target and each creature within 5 feet of it.
3–4	The bolt freezes the air around the target into jagged ice. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 cold damage and be restrained until the end of your next turn.
5	The bolt releases a pulse of necrotic energy. The target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
6	The bolt shatters to unleash a burst of shrapnel. Make six additional ranged attacks against the target, each of which has a +7 attack bonus and deals 1d6 piercing damage on a hit.
Once the bolt hits, the enchantment ends and it becomes a normal piece of ammunition.

Curse. This weapon is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the weapon or you attune to it. Attuning to the dagger curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; disposing of the dagger fails to end the curse. While cursed, whenever you receive magical healing, you must spend 1 Hit Die to regain any hit points. If you spend all your Hit Dice at any point, you die.

You can take a Bonus Action to toss this magic weapon into the air. When you do so, the weapon begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of itself. The weapon uses your attack roll and adds your ability modifier to damage rolls.

While the weapon hovers, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same Bonus Action, you can cause the weapon to attack one creature within 5 feet of the weapon.

After the hovering weapon attacks for the fourth time, it flies back to you and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, the weapon falls to the ground in your space. If the weapon has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or are more than 30 feet away from it.

This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon’s hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon’s breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.

Slumbering (Uncommon). Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon.

Stirring (Rare). The Stirring weapon has the Slumbering property. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon.

Wakened (Very Rare). The Wakened weapon has the Slumbering property, and it improves on the Stirring property. The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra damage dealt by the weapon increases to 2d6.

As an action, you can unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

This item takes the form of a leather-wrapped metal rod emblazoned with the symbol of Pelor, the Dawn Father. While grasping the rod, you can use a bonus action to cause a warhammer head of crackling radiance to spring into existence. The warhammer’s radiant head emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. You can use an action to make the radiant head disappear.

While the radiant head is active, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and attacks with the weapon deal radiant damage instead of bludgeoning damage. An undead creature hit by the weapon takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

While you are holding Duskcrusher and its radiant head is active, you can use an action to cast the sunbeam spell (save DC 15) from the weapon, and this action can’t be used again until the next dawn.

This long, whip-like strand of tough muscle bears a sharp stinger at one end. To attune to this symbiotic weapon, you wrap the whip around your wrist for the entire attunement period, during which time the whip painfully embeds its tendrils into your arm.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip, but attack rolls made against aberrations with this weapon have disadvantage. A creature hit by this weapon takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage. When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll with this weapon, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn.

As a bonus action, you can sheathe the whip by causing it to retract into your arm, or draw the whip out of your arm again.

Symbiotic Nature. The whip can’t be removed from you while you’re attuned to it, and you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you’re targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the whip ends, and it detaches from you.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has no string. Each time you pull your arm back in a firing motion, a magical arrow made of golden energy appears nocked and ready to fire. An arrow produced by this weapon deals Force damage instead of Piercing damage on a hit, and it disappears after it hits or misses its target. Until it disappears, the arrow emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet.

This weapon has the following additional properties.

Arrow of Restraint. Whenever you use this weapon to make a ranged attack against a creature, you can try to restrain the target instead of dealing damage to it. If the arrow hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the Restrained condition for 1 minute. As an action, a creature Restrained by an arrow can make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to try to break the restraint, ending the effect on itself on a successful check.

Arrow of Transport. As a Magic action, you can fire one energy arrow from this weapon at a target you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target can be either a willing Medium or smaller creature or an object that isn’t being worn or carried, provided the object is small enough to fit inside a 5-foot Cube. The arrow teleports the target to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you.

Energy Ladder. As a Magic action, you can loose a flurry of energy arrows from this weapon at a wall up to 60 feet away from yourself. The arrows become glowing rungs that stick out of the wall, forming a magical ladder up to 60 feet long on the wall. This ladder lasts for 1 minute before disappearing.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you throw it, its normal and long ranges both increase by 30 feet, and it deals one extra die of damage on a hit. After you throw it and it hits or misses, it flies back to your hand immediately.

Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.

Whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll using this weapon, the weapon bends or flies to hit you in the back. Make a new attack roll with advantage against your own AC. If the result is a hit, you take damage as if you had attacked yourself with the spear.

When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, "Swift death to you who have wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.

When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.

While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.

When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

In addition, you can speak the sword's command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.

Whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll using this weapon, the weapon bends or flies to hit you in the back. Make a new attack roll with advantage against your own AC. If the result is a hit, you take damage as if you had attacked yourself with the spear.

This transparent crystal staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

Altered Outcome. The staff has 6 charges. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges to give yourself or one other creature that you can see a d4. The recipient can roll this d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, damage roll, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn. If this extra die is not used before then, it is lost.

If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 9 or lower, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff that breaks the first time it scores a hit and deals damage. On a roll of 10 or higher, the staff regains 1d6 of its expended charges.

This magic ranged weapon is a flared pistol with the storm rune engraved along the barrel. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It requires no ammunition, its damage is thunder instead of piercing, and it doesn’t have the loading property.

Invoking the Rune. As a bonus action, you can invoke the weapon’s rune to launch a ball of energy to a point you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The energy then detonates into a 10-foot-radius sphere of turbulent wind and thunder centered on that point, and each creature in that sphere must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 thunder damage, and it can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can’t be invoked again until the next dawn.

While you are attuned to this magic weapon, your Strength is 20 unless your Strength is already equal to or greater than that score. The weapon deals an extra 1d8 Thunder damage to any creature it hits and an extra 3d8 Thunder damage to objects it hits that aren’t being worn or carried.

The weapon has the following additional properties.

Clap of Thunder. As a Magic action, you can strike the weapon against a hard surface to create a loud clap of thunder audible out to 300 feet. You also create a 30-foot Cone of thunderous energy. Each creature in the Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the Prone condition. Nonmagical objects in the Cone that aren’t being worn or carried take 3d8 Thunder damage.

Earthquake. As a Magic action, you can strike the weapon against the ground to create an intense seismic disturbance in a 50-foot-radius circle centered on the point of impact. Structures in contact with the ground in that area take 50 Bludgeoning damage, and each creature on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition. If that creature is also concentrating, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, or its Concentration is broken. In addition, you can cause a 30-foot-deep, 10-foot-wide fissure to open up on the ground anywhere in the area. Any creature on a spot where the fissure opens must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, falling into the fissure on a failed save or moving with the fissure’s edge on a successful one. Any structure on a spot where the fissure opens collapses into the fissure. Once you use this property, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger’s Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

More powerful variants of True Name gain an additional property depending on rarity:

Very Rare. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 2d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain a seal (no action required). Once you regain a seal in this way, you can’t do so again until the following dusk.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger’s Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

More powerful variants of True Name gain an additional property depending on rarity:

Very Rare. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 2d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain a seal (no action required). Once you regain a seal in this way, you can’t do so again until the following dusk.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

Very Rare. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 2d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain a seal (no action required). Once you regain a seal in this way, you can’t do so again until the following dusk.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger’s Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

More powerful variants of True Name gain an additional property depending on rarity:

Very Rare. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 2d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain a seal (no action required). Once you regain a seal in this way, you can’t do so again until the following dusk.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

Waterdeep: Dragon Heist

Forged by the archwizard Ahghairon, this intelligent battleaxe was crafted to defend Waterdeep. Its current wielder is a former member of Force Grey named Meloon Wardragon (see appendix B), but the weapon is searching for a new owner.

Azuredge has a solid steel handle etched with tiny runes, wrapped in blue dragon hide with a star sapphire set into the pommel. The axe head is forged from silver, electrum, and steel alloys whose edges constantly shimmer with a deep blue luminescence.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The shield spell provides no defense against the axe, which passes through that spell’s barrier of magical force.

When you hit a fiend or an undead with the axe, cold blue flames erupt from its blade and deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target.

Hurling. The battleaxe has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the axe, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. Whether it hits or misses, the axe flies back to you at the end of the current turn, landing in your open hand or at your feet in your space (as you choose). The axe regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Illumination. While holding the axe, you can use an action to cause the axe to glow blue or to quench the glow. This glow sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

Sentience. Azuredge is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. It has a calm, delicate voice. The weapon can sense the presence of non-lawful creatures within 120 feet of it.

Personality. Azuredge is sworn to protect Waterdeep, and it desires to be wielded by a law-abiding person willing to dedicate everything to the city’s defense. The weapon is patient and takes its time finding its ideal wielder.

If someone tries to use Azuredge against its will, the axe can become ten times heavier than normal, and can magically adhere to any Medium or larger object or surface it comes into contact with. Once it does so, the axe can’t be wielded. Nothing short of a wish spell can separate the axe from the item or surface to which it is adhered without destroying one or the other, though the axe can choose to end the effect at any time.

Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, Blackrazor shines like a piece of night sky filled with stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of cut obsidian.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties.

Devour Soul
Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature and devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be restored to life only by a wish spell.

When it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain creature’s hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep Blackrazor in hand, you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.

If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take 1d10 necrotic damage and the target regains 1d10 hit points. If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points, Blackrazor devours your soul.

Soul Hunter
While you hold the weapon, you are aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 60 feet of you that aren’t constructs or undead. You also can’t be charmed or frightened.

Blackrazor can cast the haste spell on you once per day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains concentration on it so that you don’t have to.

Sentience
Blackrazor is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every language you know.

Personality
Blackrazor speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed.

The sword’s purpose is to consume souls. It doesn’t care whose souls it eats, including the wielder’s. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along.

Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm and finds Wave tedious.

Blackrazor’s hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.

Out of the Abyss

Lost for ages in the Underdark, Dawnbringer appears to be a gilded longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear. Dawnbringer has all the properties of a sun blade.

While holding the weapon, you can use an action to touch a creature with the blade and cast lesser restoration on that creature. Once used, this ability can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Sentience. Dawnbringer is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while you’re attuned to it.

Personality. Forged by ancient sun worshipers, Dawnbringer is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies.

Long years lost in darkness have made Dawnbringer frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword.

This sword can tear the fabric of reality, creating a temporary rift between planes. You can use your action to choose a different plane of existence from the one you’re on and slice through an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself, creating a rift to that other plane. The rift can be up to 10 feet high and 10 feet wide, and it lasts for 1 minute. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

You can specify a target destination, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second layer of the Nine Hells, and the rift opens in or near that destination (DM’s discretion). If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, the rift might appear on the Street of Steel, before the Gate of Ashes, or facing the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM’s discretion.

Anything that enters the rift is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the rift.

Tears of Endless Anguish. While inside a water node, you can perform a ritual called the Tears of Endless Anguish, using Drown to create a devastation orb of water (see the devastation orb description for the time and cost of the ritual). Once you perform the ritual, Drown can’t be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

Flaw. Drown makes its wielder covetous. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: “I demand and deserve the largest share of the spoils, and I refuse to part with anything that’s mine.” In addition, if you are attuned to Drown for 24 consecutive hours, barnacles form on your skin. The barnacles can be removed with a greater restoration spell or similar magic, but not while you are attuned to the weapon.

While Fenthras is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you make an attack with Fenthras, you can declare it an oracle shot, allowing you to experience the area around the arrow using your normal senses for 10 minutes. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when a creature is killed by an attack using this weapon, a six-foot-tall tree rapidly grows out of the corpse over the next minute. The tree is rooted in the ground to make the body difficult to move, but does not permanently damage the corpse or its organs.

This gorgeous longbow made of everbark from the Fey Realm flexes and shifts like a living entity. It is said to have been wielded by the legendary ranger Vex’ahlia against great evils.

Dormant
While Fenthras is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you make an attack with Fenthras, you can declare it an oracle shot, allowing you to experience the area around the arrow using your normal senses for 10 minutes. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when a creature is killed by an attack using this weapon, a six-foot-tall tree rapidly grows out of the corpse over the next minute. The tree is rooted in the ground to make the body difficult to move, but does not permanently damage the corpse or its organs.

Awakened
When Fenthras reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2. Additionally, when you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d4 lightning damage.
When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can declare it a bramble shot. The attack deals an extra 3d8 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become restrained by steely brambles that burst from the arrow. A restrained target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.
Exalted
When Fenthras reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:

The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.
The extra lightning damage dealt by attacks using the bow increases to 1d6.
You can declare a bramble shot twice between rests, and the saving throw DC increases to 17.

When you hit with an attack roll using it, the target takes an extra 5d4 damage of your choice of one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

While holding the flail, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause the heads to breathe multicolored flames in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 damage of one of the following damage types (your choice): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. Once this action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

This blade appears to be a beautiful cruciform sword of shining silver, inlaid with sparkling rubies. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the following properties.

Corrosive Submission. When you hit a creature that has an Intelligence score of 4 or higher with an attack using this sword, the target takes an extra 3d6 acid damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. If you attack the creature again while it is charmed in this way, the extra acid damage increases to 10d6 and the charmed condition ends. If the target succeeds on its saving throw or the charm ends for it, it can’t be charmed again in this way for 24 hours.

Hidden Nature. The acid damage dealt by this greatsword appears to be radiant damage to all who perceive it. A true seeing spell or similar magic reveals that the sword is actually a rusted, pitted blade dripping with acid.

Sentience. Graz’tchar is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Anyone who holds it hears the wise voice of a sorrowful king, beckoning the user to seize their destiny. A creature that succeeds on a DC 26 Wisdom (Insight) check while listening to the blade’s voice hears a sliver of malice that suggests the truth: the voice is a corrupting trick of the Demon Prince of Indulgence.

Personality. Graz’tchar slowly attempts to sway its wielder to sow chaos in Exandria, telling lies and spreading malign truths about great leaders, and claiming that the members of the Tal’Dorei Council are corrupt and must be overthrown. The voice of this blade is actually the Demon Prince of Indulgence, speaking from his Abyssal prison.

If the sword’s attuned wielder disobeys the urges of the weapon for an extended period of time, Graz’tchar can attempt to control the wielder, who must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or become charmed by the sword for 24 hours. While the wielder is charmed in this way, the sword can compel them to take an action of the sword’s choice once per hour, though the wielder believes this action is taken of their own free will. If the chosen action leads to the harm of someone the wielder considers a trusted friend or ally, the charmed condition immediately ends. On a successful saving throw or if the charmed condition ends for the wielder, they are immune to this property of the sword for 24 hours.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword.

This sword can tear the fabric of reality, creating a temporary rift between planes. You can use your action to choose a different plane of existence from the one you’re on and slice through an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself, creating a rift to that other plane. The rift can be up to 10 feet high and 10 feet wide, and it lasts for 1 minute. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

You can specify a target destination, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second layer of the Nine Hells, and the rift opens in or near that destination (DM’s discretion). If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, the rift might appear on the Street of Steel, before the Gate of Ashes, or facing the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM’s discretion.

Anything that enters the rift is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the rift.

In the Year of the Icy Axe (123 DR), the frost giant lord Gurt fell to Uthgar Gardolfsson—leader of the folk who would become the Uthgardt—in a battle that marked the ascendance of humankind over the giants in the Dessarin Valley. Gurt’s greataxe was buried in Morgur’s Mound until it was unearthed and brought back to Waterdeep. After laying in the city’s vaults for decades, the axe was given to Harshnag, a frost giant adventurer, in recognition of his service to Waterdeep. Uthgardt recognize the weapon on sight and attack any giant that wields it.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It is sized for a frost giant, weighs 325 pounds, and deals 3d12 slashing damage on a hit, plus an extra 2d12 slashing damage if the target is human.

The axe sheds light as a torch when the temperature around it drops below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The light can’t be shut off in these conditions.

As an action, you can cast a version of the heat metal spell (save DC 13) that deals cold damage instead of fire damage. Once this power is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

This sacred weapon was forged to burn away deception and darkness. Blazing embers gently fall from the silver blade, first ignited by the brazier in the Temple of Lumen.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties:

You can use a bonus action to speak the sword’s name, causing radiant flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 4d6 radiant damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to douse the blade, or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

Sentience. Ignacious is a sentient lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 19, and a Charisma of 23. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, Celestial, and Draconic, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. It always knows its wielder’s thoughts. Its voice is commanding, righteous, and booming. When drawn, Ignacious casts the zone of truth spell (save DC 20), and maintains concentration on it so that you don’t have to. The zone of truth moves with the blade and remains centred on it.

Personality. Ignacious is zealously devoted to the Sacred Flame, and has memorized every word of its holy texts. The blade wishes to be wielded by a faithful devotee of any sort; Ignacious does not care about the religious divide between the Falling Fire and the Sacred Flame so long as its wielder keeps the core tenets shared by both sects.

The sword’s purpose is to expose all deception and reveal the truth. It does not tolerate any falsehood, duplicitousness, or lies. The sword always knows when it hears a lie, and responds with wrathful fury. If a wielder speaks a lie, it immediately triggers a conflict.

Relics of Saint Vitruvio
These holy relics of the Sacred Flame were wielded by Saint Vitruvio and are kept in several religious sites throughout Drakkenheim. The Knights of the Silver Order and the Followers of the Falling Fire now seek these relics. Not only do both factions revere Saint Vitruvio, both wish to use these relics to help advance their goals in Drakkenheim.

A character attuned to three Relics of Saint Vitruvio may cast the heal spell three times per day, after which they must finish a long rest before they may do so again. In addition, that character gains the ability to attune to two additional magic items so long as those magic items are both Relics of Saint Vitruvio.

A war pick forged from a single piece of iron, Ironfang has a fang-like head inscribed with ancient runes. The pick is heavy in the hand, but when the wielder swings the pick in anger, the weapon seems almost weightless. This weapon is immune to any form of rust, acid, or corrosion — nothing seems to mark it. Ironfang contains a spark of moch, the Prince of Evil Earth.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 1d8 thunder damage.

Earth Mastery. You gain the following benefits while you hold Ironfang:

You can speak Terran fluently.
You have resistance to acid damage.
You have tremorsense out to a range of 60 feet.
You can sense the presence of precious metals and stones within 60 feet of you, but not their exact location.
You can cast dominate monster (save DC 17) on an earth elemental. Once you have done so, Ironfang can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
Shatter. Ironfang has 3 charges. You can use your action to expend 1 charge and cast the 2nd-level version of shatter (DC 17). Ironfang regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

The Rumbling. While inside an earth node, you can perform a ritual called the Rumbling, using Ironfang to create a devastation orb of earth (see the devastation orb description for the time and cost of the ritual). Once you perform the ritual, Ironfang can’t be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

Flaw. Ironfang heightens its wielder’s destructive nature. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: “I like to break things and cause ruin.”

In the world of Greyhawk, only nine of these blades are known to exist. Each is patterned after the legendary sword Fragarach, which is variously translated as “Final Word.” Each of the nine swords has its own name and alignment, and each bears a different gem in its pommel.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this sword. In addition, while you hold the sword, you can use your reaction to make one melee attack with it against any creature in your reach that deals damage to you. You have advantage on the attack roll, and any damage dealt with this special attack ignores any damage immunity or resistance the target has.

Last Quip is the Chaotic Neutral sword and contains a tourmaline as its gem.

This ivory longbow is inscribed with a prayer to the god Hiatea, the runes of which are entwined with gilded engravings of wheat stalks and deer antlers.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one magic arrow when you pull back the string. The arrow created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

The bow has 8 charges for the following properties, which you can use while wielding the bow. The bow regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn.

Curative Arrow. When you take the Attack action using the bow, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your attacks with a blazing arrow of curative magic, which automatically hits one creature you can see within 150 feet of you. The target can then immediately spend and roll one of its unspent Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

If the target has no unspent Hit Dice remaining, nothing happens. You can use a curative arrow only once per turn.

Spellcasting. While holding the bow, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 18): create food and water (1 charge), warding bond (2 charges), guardian of faith (3 charges).

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword.

This sword can tear the fabric of reality, creating a temporary rift between planes. You can use your action to choose a different plane of existence from the one you’re on and slice through an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself, creating a rift to that other plane. The rift can be up to 10 feet high and 10 feet wide, and it lasts for 1 minute. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

You can specify a target destination, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second layer of the Nine Hells, and the rift opens in or near that destination (DM’s discretion). If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, the rift might appear on the Street of Steel, before the Gate of Ashes, or facing the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM’s discretion.

Anything that enters the rift is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the rift.

Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a moonblade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.

A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.

A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.

A moonblade won’t serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.

A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moonblade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.

Moonblade Properties
d100	Property
01–40	Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the moonblade already has a +3 bonus.
41–80	The moonblade gains a randomly determined minor property (see “Special Features”).
81–82	The moonblade gains the finesse property.
83–84	The moonblade gains the thrown property (range 20/60 feet).
85–86	The moonblade functions as a defender.
87–90	The moonblade scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
91–92	When you hit with an attack using the moonblade, the attack deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage.
93–94	When you hit a creature of a specific type (such as dragon, fiend, or undead) with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.
95–96	You can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade to flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t be used again until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon.
97–98	The moonblade functions as a ring of spell storing.
99	You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, provided that you don’t already have one serving you. The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a shadow, except it is neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, and doesn’t create new shadows. You control this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action.
00	The moonblade functions as a vorpal sword.

Sentience
A moonblade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder’s hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.

Personality
Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.

The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.

If a moonblade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.

Of all the magic items created by elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a Moonblade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such weapon. Over the centuries, some of these weapons have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Others have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.

Every Moonblade longs for a bearer whose disposition and goals are compatible with its own. If you try to attune to a Moonblade that doesn’t want you as its bearer, the weapon not only rejects you but also places a curse on you, causing you to make D20 Tests with Disadvantage for 24 hours or until the curse is ended by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic. If you’re accepted by the weapon and try to attune to it, you become attuned to it instantly, and a new rune appears on it. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. A Moonblade functions like a nonmagical weapon of its kind for anyone other than its chosen bearer.

A Moonblade has one rune on it for each bearer it has willingly served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the Moonblade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly by rolling on the Moonblade Properties table.

Minor Property. In addition to its aforementioned properties, each Moonblade has a minor property determined by rolling on the Magic Item’s Minor Property table.

Sentience. A Moonblade is a sentient weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet. Its alignment matches that of its creator.

The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder’s hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate through visions or dreams when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.

Personality. A Moonblade has a personality similar to that of its creator. Once a Moonblade has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the bearer’s alignment differs from that of the weapon’s or the bearer’s goals later clash with the weapon’s goals.

61-75	When you hit with an attack roll using the Moonblade, you deal an extra 1d6 Force damage. Each time the weapon gains this property after the first, the extra damage increases by 1d6, to a maximum of 3d6. Reroll if the Moonblade already deals an extra 3d6 Force damage on a hit.
76-80	The Moonblade gains the Thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack.
81-85	The Moonblade scores a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
86-95	You can take a Bonus Action to cause the Moonblade to flash brightly. Each other creature that is within 30 feet of you and not behind Total Cover must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can’t use this property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
96-99	The Moonblade has the properties of a Ring of Spell Storing.
100	You can take a Magic action to conjure a spectral entity that resembles a shadowy elf if you don’t already have one serving you. The entity appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the Shadow stat block with these changes: it is a Fey, has a Neutral alignment, and doesn’t create new shadows. You control this entity, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 Hit Points or you dismiss it as a Magic action.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 radiant damage.

While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.

Sentience. Nepenthe is a sentient, neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can read and understand Elvish. It can also speak Elvish, but only through the voice of its wielder, with whom the sword can communicate telepathically.

Personality. In its lifetime, the sword has beheaded thousands of criminals, not all of whom were guilty of the crimes for which they were convicted. The sword cannot distinguish the guilty from the innocent. With each beheading, it hungers for more justice and blood. The sword is corrupt and irredeemable.

Princes of the Apocalypse

A mighty axe wielded long ago by the dwarf king Torhild Flametongue, Orcsplitter is a battered weapon that appears unremarkable at first glance. Its head is graven with the Dwarvish runes for “orc,” but the runes are depicted with a gap or slash through the markings; the word “orc” is literally split in two.

You gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon:

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an orc, that orc must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.
You can’t be surprised by orcs while you’re not incapacitated. You are also aware when orcs are within 120 feet of you and aren’t behind total cover, although you don’t know their location.
You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can’t be frightened while you’re not incapacitated.
Sentience. Orcsplitter is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has darkvision. It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder’s mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse.

Personality. Orcsplitter is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face orcs in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon’s purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves — giants, goblins, and, most of all, orcs — and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Its blade is cruelly serrated, and its hilt resembles a demonic head and wings. Whenever you slay a creature with an attack using the dagger, the creature’s soul is imprisoned inside the dagger, and that creature can be restored to life only by a wish spell. The dagger can hold a maximum of five souls.

For each soul imprisoned in the dagger, your attacks with it deal an extra 1d4 necrotic damage on a hit. While the dagger is within 5 feet of you, your dreams are haunted by whispers from the trapped souls.

The dagger has the following additional properties.

Siphon Vitality. As a bonus action, you can release any number of stored souls from the dagger to regain 1d10 hit points per soul released.

Annihilation. If the dagger holds five souls, you can use this property: As a reaction immediately after you hit a creature with the dagger and deal damage to that target, you can release all five souls. If the target now has fewer than 75 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. If the target dies, you can’t use this property again until you finish a long rest.

This sword can tear the fabric of reality, creating a temporary rift between planes. You can use your action to choose a different plane of existence from the one you’re on and slice through an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself, creating a rift to that other plane. The rift can be up to 10 feet high and 10 feet wide, and it lasts for 1 minute. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

You can specify a target destination, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second layer of the Nine Hells, and the rift opens in or near that destination (DM’s discretion). If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, the rift might appear on the Street of Steel, before the Gate of Ashes, or facing the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM’s discretion.

Anything that enters the rift is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the rift.

Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the stunned condition until the start of your next turn.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can’t be invoked again until the next dawn.

Ruinblade is a unique weapon possessed by Moghadam, the architect of the Tomb of Horrors. A symbol of his authority, Moghadam carries the weapon during the time frame of the adventure to intimidate the tomb’s workers. (In later years, after Acererak trapped Moghadam in the completed tomb as an undead archwraith, Moghadam was able to use the weapon as his own phylactery.)

A small jade version of the green devil face of the Tomb of Horrors is fashioned into the hilt of the weapon, with the blade extending from its open mouth. The blade always appears ruined and rusting, and causes its surroundings to appear reflected in the blade as if in a state of decay.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit an undead creature with it, the attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage.

In addition, the weapon has the following properties:

Blighted Ruin. You can cast the blight spell from the weapon (DC 15). Once used, this property of the weapon can’t be used until the next dawn.

Destructive Ruin. You can cast the disintegrate spell from the weapon, but can target only a nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. Once used, this property of the weapon can’t be used until dawn seven days later.

Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a remove curse spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon.

The weapon must take direct part in the destruction of 1,000 gp worth of materials and objects every seven days, or a conflict arises between you and the weapon at the end of the seventh day.

Sentience. Ruinblade is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is a rough, ruined echo. While you are attuned to it, Ruinblade also understands every language you know.

Personality. Ruinblade speaks either with a dolorous or frenetic tone, depending on its mood. That mood improves when the sword is actively engaged in acts of destruction, but worsens if the blade is left inactive too long.

The weapon’s purpose is to ruin and unmake existing objects, so that its owner can rebuild the world from a blank slate. It thus encourages its wielder to engage in constant destruction, claiming that this will allow the creation of a more superior vision from the ruin of what came before.

The rift can be up to 10 feet high and 10 feet wide, and it lasts for 1 minute. Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

You can specify a target destination, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second layer of the Nine Hells, and the rift opens in or near that destination (DM’s discretion). If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, the rift might appear on the Street of Steel, before the Gate of Ashes, or facing the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM’s discretion.

Anything that enters the rift is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the rift.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic vorpal sword. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage. When you use this weapon to attack a creature that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature’s heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, it doesn’t have or need a head, it has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.

While attuned to Snicker-Snack, you have proficiency with greatswords, and you can use your Charisma modifier instead of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

Sentience. Snicker-Snack is a sentient, chaotic good greatsword with an Intelligence of 9, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can speak, read, and understand Common, and its voice sounds silvery and melodic. Snicker-Snack craves the destruction of evil Dragons and urges you to seek out these creatures and slay them.

Snicker-Snack has a fickle personality. It ends its attunement to you if you miss on attack rolls with the weapon three times in a row. Each time you finish a long rest after that happens, you can attempt to regain the sword’s trust by making a contested Charisma check against Snicker-Snack. If you win the contest, your attunement to the weapon is instantly restored. Your attunement to the weapon can’t be restored in any other way.

The thick, grooved blade of this shining silver longsword is lined with etched runes that sparkle blue in the light. Star Razor—known also as Dwueth’var— was thought to have been destroyed or lost after the Calamity, but new rumors suggest that it might be wielded by a half-orc somewhere in Wildemount.

Dormant
While Star Razor is in a dormant state, you can hold this magic longsword and use a bonus action to speak the command word Galas-var, causing the sword to emit a pale blue glow that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This glow lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

While this longsword is glowing, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon, and you have resistance to radiant damage.
You can cast the faerie fire spell from the weapon as an action, requiring no components (save DC 13). Once a spell has been cast using Star Razor, that spell can’t be cast from the sword until the next dawn.
Awakened
When Star Razor reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.
When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to create a burst of radiance from the sword, dealing 1d8 radiant damage to the attacker.
You can cast the see invisibility spell from the sword as an action, and the save DC for spells cast using the sword increases to 15.

Curse of Strahd, pg. 223

The Sunsword is a unique blade once possessed by Strahd’s brother, Sergei von Zarovich. In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel.

Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei’s death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice’s mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire’s wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.

The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a sun blade.

Sentience. The Sunsword is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions to the creature carrying or wielding it.

Personality. The Sunsword’s special purpose is to destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge for the loss of its crystal blade. The weapon secretly fears its own destruction.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage.

Fire Mastery. You gain the following benefits while you hold Tinderstrike:

You can speak Ignan fluently.

You can cast dominate monster (save DC 17) on a fire elemental. Once you have done so, Tinderstrike can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
Dance of the All-Consuming Fire. While inside a fire node, you can perform a ritual called the Dance of the All-Consuming Fire, using Tinderstrike to create a devastation orb of fire (see the devastation orb description for the time and cost of the ritual). Once you perform the ritual, Tinderstrike can’t be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

Flaw. Tinderstrike makes its wielder impatient and rash. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: “I act without thinking and take risks without weighing the consequences.”

This magic ranged weapon resembles a musket, but in lieu of any ammunition, it holds a glowing yellow scale from a topaz dragon in its heart.

The weapon has a normal range of 100 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it has the two-handed property. It deals 2d6 necrotic damage on a hit. If this damage reduces a creature or object to 0 hit points, the target is reduced to dust. A creature reduced to dust can be restored to life only by a true resurrection or wish spell.

While the weapon is on your person, you can use an action to cast the disintegrate spell (save DC 18). Once this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger’s Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

More powerful variants of True Name gain an additional property depending on rarity:

Legendary. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 3d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain two seals and gain temporary hit points equal to your illrigger level (no action required). Once you regain seals and gain temporary hit points in this way, you can’t do so again until the following dusk.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

This weapon is ornately decorated with elegant details in brimstone and obsidian. It smells of iron and incense. When you attune to this weapon, you must whisper your true name to it. The name sears across the weapon in Infernal runes, then fades.

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger’s Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

More powerful variants of True Name gain an additional property depending on rarity:

Legendary. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 3d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain two seals and gain temporary hit points equal to your illrigger level (no action required). Once you regain seals and gain temporary hit points in this way, you can’t do so again until the following dusk.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

The typical True Name, an uncommon item, empowers an illrigger’s Baleful Interdict. Whenever you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on your attack roll with this weapon and place a seal on a creature as part of the attack, you can place an additional seal on that creature.

More powerful variants of True Name gain an additional property depending on rarity:

Legendary. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 3d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain two seals and gain temporary hit points equal to your illrigger level (no action required). Once you regain seals and gain temporary hit points in this way, you can’t do so again until the following dusk.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

More powerful variants of True Name gain an additional property depending on rarity:

Legendary. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 3d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain two seals and gain temporary hit points equal to your illrigger level (no action required). Once you regain seals and gain temporary hit points in this way, you can’t do so again until the following dusk.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

Legendary. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon, and the damage dealt by your seals increases by 3d6. In addition, when you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points, you can choose to regain two seals and gain temporary hit points equal to your illrigger level (no action required). Once you regain seals and gain temporary hit points in this way, you can’t do so again until the following dusk.

“The weapon known as True Name is inseparable from the history of the Seven Cities. Whenever two devils entered into a deal with one another, the offeree of the contract would seal their true name into its ornamentations, then the blade would remain in the possession of the offerer. Should the offeree fail to uphold their end of the contract, the offerer would magically learn the name from the blade, thus gaining power over they who betrayed the sacred pact.

Is there, thus, any blade with more potential? It is written that if an infernal soul could discover the true name of the weapon itself, they could draw from it every name sworn to it since the blade’s creation. Imagine the power that individual would have over the Seven Cities. Imagine the proud devils who could do naught but fall to their knees.

I have sought the blade’s name for centuries. With luck, when I find it, its bearer will not know the power they wield, and it will be mine.”

Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, this trident is an exquisite weapon engraved with images of waves, shells, and sea creatures. Although you must worship a god of the sea to attune to this weapon, Wave happily accepts new converts.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you score a critical hit with it, the target takes extra necrotic damage equal to half its hit point maximum.

The weapon also functions as a trident of fish command and a weapon of warning. It can confer the benefit of a cap of water breathing while you hold it, and you can use it as a cube of force by choosing the effect, instead of pressing cube sides to select it.

Sentience
Wave is a sentient weapon of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a speak with animals spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder in the conversation.

Personality
When it grows restless, Wave has a habit of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred hymns of the sea gods.

Wave zealously desires to convert mortals to the worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon’s objectives in the world.

The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged Wave in an act of devotion to—or rebellion against—that god.

Wave harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, Wave fears that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god’s demise. This destiny is something Wave might not be able to avert.

Waythe is a unique greatsword most recently in the possession of a high-ranking cloud giant ambassador.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature of the giant type with it, the giant takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage, and it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

The sword also functions as a wand of enemy detection. It regains all of its expended charges at dawn and isn’t at risk of crumbling if its last charge is used.

Sentience. Waythe is a sentient weapon of neutral good alignment, with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 2, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon can speak and understand Giant and Common, and it can communicate telepathically with its wielder.

Personality. This sword believes in freedom and allowing others to live as they see fit. It is protective of its friends, and wants to be friends with a like-minded wielder. (It takes only 1 minute for a good-aligned character to gain attunement with the sword.) Waythe is courageous to the point of foolhardiness, however, and vocally urges bold action. It is likely to come into conflict with an evil or a timid wielder.

Whelm is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with Whelm, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime sky.

Thrown Weapon
Whelm has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don’t have a hand free, the weapon lands at your feet.

Shock Wave
You can use an action to strike the ground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Supernatural Awareness
While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast detect evil and good or locate object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can’t cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.

Sentience
Whelm is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish, Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used in combat.

Personality
Whelm’s purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves.

Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm.

The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan.

This ornate rod is topped by a pair of butterfly wings and incorporates bits of red glass into its length. It weighs 3 pounds.

Magic Weapon. In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the vane can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. In addition, the vane deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.

Sense Mood. While the vane is inside the perimeter of the Witchlight Carnival, it can sense the mood of every creature in the carnival that has an Intelligence of 4 or higher. As an action, a creature attuned to the vane can use it to pinpoint the location of the happiest creature in the carnival.

The butterfly shape at the top of the vane spins slowly clockwise when spirits in the carnival are generally high; if the general mood in the carnival is dour, the top of the vane spins slowly counterclockwise.

Sentience. The vane is a sentient, chaotic good wondrous item with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet, and it communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature attuned to it. Its purpose is to make sure everyone in the Witchlight Carnival is having a good time.

Additional Properties. The vane has the following additional properties:

The creature holding the vane has vulnerability to lightning damage.
The creature attuned to the vane can’t be blinded, deafened, petrified, or stunned.
While carrying the vane, the creature attuned to it can cast the dancing lights, polymorph, or ray of frost spell as an action, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability. After the vane’s polymorph spell is cast, roll a d8; on a roll of 3 or 8, the vane can’t be used to cast this spell again until the next dawn.
